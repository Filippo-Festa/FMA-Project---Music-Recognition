# Improved Music Genre Classification with Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains the implementation of a research project focused on improving music genre classification (MGC) using Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TCNNs). Traditional deep learning methods have shown promise in MGC tasks, yet they often struggle with capturing intricate temporal patterns present in music data. This project explores several innovative approaches to address these challenges:

## Key Features

1. **Residual Learning with TCNNs:** Combines TCNNs with residual learning techniques to enhance the network's depth and ability to learn complex temporal dependencies without significantly increasing the computational burden.

2. **Temporal Data Exploration:** Examines the effectiveness of different types of temporal data (such as waveforms, Mel spectrograms, and images) when processed through TCNNs.

3. **Bottleneck Residual Configuration:** Proposes a novel TCNN architecture incorporating bottleneck residual blocks, allowing for deeper network structures while maintaining computational efficiency.

## FMA Dataset

The implementation builds upon the [**FMA (Free Music Archive) dataset**](https://github.com/mdeff/fma), a public dataset containing a rich variety of music tracks. The FMA dataset is well-suited for music information retrieval tasks, including genre classification, and is widely used in the research community due to its diversity and scale.

## Research Outcomes

Although some results are partial and not fully satisfactory, the approach shows potential, particularly in applications beyond music genre classification, such as speech recognition and video analysis.
